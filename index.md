### iOS Application - Instaurant
Fall 2018 | Instructor: Todd Sproull | Team: Tiancheng He, Junji Heng, Pengqiu Meng, Zifan Wan

This is the final project of _Mobile Application Development_. ([View Code](https://github.com/chengyuegong/Instaurant))

Instaurant is an iOS application for accessing the instant restaurant information. The information would be displayed on AR (Augmented Reality) Camera when the camera is aiming at the storefront of a resturant. The Firebase was chosen as the database of this application, which stored the resturant information. If the resturant is not in our database, the user is able to add one through our application by submitting the name, location, storefront picture, and the physical size of the storefront of that restaurant. The detailed data is retrieved from Yelp API.

### A Supervised Learning Approach to Pronoun Resolution
Spring 2018 | Instructor: Ming Yue

This is the undergraduate graduation project. ([View Code](https://github.com/chengyuegong/PronounResolution_MLApproach))

This system applied a supervised machine learning approach to pronoun resolution of the Chinese word “􏱅那”. The system was comprised of two parts, namely NLP modules and an ML module. The NLP modules processed the raw data and automatically generated feature vectors, while the ML module learned and applied what it learned to the new data. In the NLP modules, manual annotation is engaged to generate labeled data for the ML module. The raw data of the research is from CCL (Center for Chinese Linguistics of Peking University) corpus and the supervised learning approaches used in the research are SVM (Support Vector Machine), KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) and Naive Bayes.

### WiFi Probe Data Collection System
Fall 2016 | Instructor: Tatiana Kozlova Madsen, Lars Møller Mikkelsen | Team: Christian H. Liboriussen, Tarik Muhovic, Jinwon Chun

This is the semester-long project. (The code is unauthorized to be published)

The system securely and reliably transmitted collected WiFi probes to measure the amount of people on a bus in real time. The Raspberry Pi was chosen as the hardware platform for this system and the software was written in Java. Moreover, the TLS 1.2 was chosen to secure the transmissions. A central server would collected and handled the data transmitted from Raspberry Pi on buses and displayed the data on a website.

### Greenhouse Simulation System
Fall 2016 | Instructor: Jan Dimon Bendtsen | Team: Christian H. Liboriussen, Tarik Muhovic, Jinwon Chun

This is the coursework of _OOAD, Test and Verification_. ([View Code](https://github.com/chengyuegong/Greenhouse-Simulation))

The Java application was capable of simulating a primitive greenhouse where the temperature and humidity would rise or fall depending on the status of the windows and dehumidifier. The user could use the client to view the current status of the greenhouse in form of the current temperature and humidity and the status of the window and dehumidifier. The user could also decide what the limit should be for the temperature and humidity by using max/min sliders provided in the client GUI application. When the new request is submitted, the client and the server would communicate with each other through TCP connection and the server would reconfigure the greenhouse simulator to keep the humidity and temperature within the decided limits.
